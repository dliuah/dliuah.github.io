This month the ladder feels easier than usual. I got some very strong generals available to choose. 

The Saturday news was not too much a shock. However, A is stumble today but HK stock continues to grow. Maybe it's indeed a US dollar liquidity thing.

Diamond pushup is not too difficult now. I'd better wash my hair everyday.
