Tried scrapping today. The dynamic website adds more difficulty. May need to simulate human behavior when I have time.

The real estate are growing so rapidly. The news did matter, when a policy changes, the stock price can grow several folds. So what are the other industries that were
trapped recently. US listed stocks have bounced a lot due to lifting lockdown. Others are chips? This will be hard, I guess. And education? Still no sign of change.

May go to watch Avatar 2 when on shown.
