Same thing may have different meaning to different individuals. For me, it may just be a game, but it may mean a lot for others, taking most of their
time. Or it may just be some assets for me, and a belief for others, a key to future career. Maybe I should slow down, for feelings and relationship.
But for my own life's experience, this is not an option. The time left for me is descreasing day by day.
