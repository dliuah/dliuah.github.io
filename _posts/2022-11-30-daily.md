The **elderly** passed away today. He is widely respected, and will be memorized.

**Dada** is still shouting at around 6am, with a lot of energy. Guess he needs some exercise at daytime. Maybe a company? Or I need to do some morning 
exercise with him. But my sleeping time is precious now. Hard choice. I guess it's not possible to force him not shouting.
