I went to sleep late today, climbing the ladder, without much improvement. The thing is no matter how strong my general is, I still can't fight 3 people.
If the reward is what I am fighting for, it's totally not worth the time I put into it. I have much better entertainment. I sometimes just push myself for
some meaningless goal. I need to set a rule, no more alone climbing. I'd rather watch some animations.
