The news press didn't bring the news out. In the mid term, I am not oppotimistic about the stocks. But in the short run, I do feel now is a point where 
government will feel obliged to do something to unite confidence. It may stumble, bouncing back and forth, but the possiblity of going down is low. This 
reminds me of one important fact, the goverment may also set some key points of stock index, considering it as stability point, and will use news or 
policies to gather people's importance. So the news spread in a lot of wechat groups are the original info, its credibility is actually backed by 
many so called insiders. It's fake will be the first derivative. Given there are so many chat groups spreading the same info, the second derivative will
be it may be a on purpose leaking info, to get people prepared or to see their reactions. Given today's press, the third derivative will be the info was
just an experiment, not to truly implemented. 

The pantheon was really good. Not like the uploaded tv series which is a no brainer. This one's plot is great. 

I will buy something for double eleven.
