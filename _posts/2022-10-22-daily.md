Recently I watched more animations than the TV series with human acting. Animation has less limitation and can be more creative in story telling.
The recent watch list includes **Rick and Morty** new season, **Cyberpunk Edgerunner** and **Pantheon**.

I can't find any good and comprehensive **time series** open courses. Is this topic too complicated? The classic testbook by Hamilton is hard for me. 
Just like the **Stochastic Process** by Sheldon M Ross, there's not much left in my brain after I finished reading. 

The hot pot of beef station has rich food variety. However, the Chongqing taste is not strong in flavour, although is very spicy. I prefer **Niuzhen** to this.
This is a resturant list in HK.

The **Union Fight** ended with 5 wins. I can't argue too much given that the general candidates were mediocre and I had bad luck.
