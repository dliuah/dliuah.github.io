Today Union fight got 16. Though teammate was short in generals, the candidates were reasonable and the opponents seemed weaker than usual. The variance 
of the Union fight can be so big.

I still want to cook steamed noodles sometime. Let me try if there's some easy version.

Titter, Musk and Web3, it could really be something. I may keep an eye on it.
