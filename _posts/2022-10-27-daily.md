Today I want to make an analogy between fluid and markets. First, they all have waves. Next, there's non-linear structure, chaos. So what about some 
fundamental properties comparison. What is price, particle? The price has speed. What's momentum? In other words, what's mass in the markets? The volume?
There may be some sense. 

What's the structrue similarity when there's a shock. There's discontinuity. I may need to check the shock's equation.

What about molecule dynamics. Particles collide each other, with random brownian motion. Different participants pull the price to different directions. 
They interact through price. How can I model the price movement through modelling each participant? What's some basic rules. 

So maybe the RSI, MACD, KDJ are like Renolds number, St, reduced frequency, etc. They may not tell you whether the price will go up or down. But they do 
tell what's the regime the price is going through. Can I PCA the price segment to identify the underlying pattern? After the pattern, maybe I can better 
predict the price.

What else, price times the volume, if it's momentum. Energy is price change square times volume? That makes sense. About energy, is there a kinetic, 
gravitational, elastic energy?

OK! One more push, what else can I think of? Is there a boundary condition? Maybe there is. 

I complaint to Dada today about his smell, and he replied with a Meow, which is quite funny.
