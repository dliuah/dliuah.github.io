Around one month ago a lot of chat groups were spreading a gossip about lifting the lockdown. The stock market has gone up by around 40% overall. Some tech
companies soared more. I remembered there was a press release later stating that the zero policy wouldn't change. Then there was the protest. The government 
let the students go home early this year. There has been virus spreading to hometown. Originally I thought my hometown should be small enough to be less
affected. Now my grandma's 2 neighbors have been tested positive within the same building. There maybe a half half population pro or con zero policy.
Just different group of people speaking at different times. Granny should get the vac if possible. It's better if there's home service. If the virus can be
treated as a flu, what's the diff with traditional ones? Larger population got affected? Meaning I might got it every month? It's not comfortable to have a
fever.

What's the diff of buying houses in 90s with buying cryptos now? Because house is touchable? Just so many people buying it.
