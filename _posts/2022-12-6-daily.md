The HK stocks grew a lot due to lift of lockdown of 6 major cities from weekends. There may be some day trading opportunities, but requiring paying attention.

The US stock start high but ended at yesterday high, it's a bad signal, at least meaning stagnant period.

What should I learn at spare time? C++ is definitely a good choice. Maybe some more ML courses.
