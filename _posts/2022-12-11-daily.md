Did some works on weekends. Feels ok, not tired. Also played many games.

Let me make some guesses based on some information gained. Me personally haven't watched a single **World Cup** game. I remembered France won last cup? I
guess it's still champion this time. 60% confident.

Many friends I know got the **covid**. Now I understand the logic of online medicine shop's stock rise. I checked the funeral business, although kind of 
gloomy, but found the price is not cheap already. I guess I need to make some inference after some events happened or policy changed, I just need to think
a step further.

Will web3 developer really be a hit? The tech is exciting. Now I can see it. Basically autonomous governance should be the next level evolution.
