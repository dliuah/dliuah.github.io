Today **Billizards** announced it would end cooperation with Netease. Games like Hearthstone will be closed at the beginning of 2023.
The deal broke may due to unagreement of the profit distribution and other terms. Will it be a good news for sgs? We will see.

The **patheon** is getting better. There is one thing though, you can't get a complete person just by scanning the brain, if it's possible.
The eyeballs also has it processors, like GPU maybe. So you'd better scan a whole person. But still, you replicate a person, either though gene, or 
digitalization, will it be the same? I guess not. Will I be the same with me 1 min ago? Did me one minutes ago die? What is death then? If each moment me
is different.
