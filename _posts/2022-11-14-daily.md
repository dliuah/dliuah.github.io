I am under some pressure now. First is the deadline. Maybe I am not accustomed to it. But it should be a helper later. Next is the industry.
I am not very worried that it may colapse, just that things may be different, strategy may not be effective. Also, it's more of a risk control
priority than alpha seeking. Not attention paid to it. Still, if I really like my job, I shouldn't care about other things, just focus on my work's
performance. I feel I code slower recently, I need to clear my mind and focus.

Though some city let out some signal that ban may be lift off, the best perf stocks are ventilator, medicine. Tourist is crushing. So just people still
worried about the situation later, instead of celebrating freedom. Or people who celebrate don't buy stocks. Still, there's more uncertainty.
