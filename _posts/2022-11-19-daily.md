Today I played with two strangers for the first time. One is certainly not so familiar, the other likes to make command, but is OK. For me, I might
perform better at the gold game, to be more conservative. However, it maybe the same as the boss has the ak and all. This situation is kind of rare, 
but as we player together for the first time, I guess we should have more chances. The Union leader just asked me to hand in my account. Haha, that's a
goodbye then. I may go to another union, with many good players but not so much stress. The first two unions are just lost in the races, without forcusing 
on the true meaning of the game. I do hope to make some friends, but actually Qingtian members are not so good players, as far as those played with me.
The silver lining is I found Guanyu in the shop.

A gathering with other zjuers tonight. 7 people with 5 in finance, first and secondary markets half by half. Most topics are about kids. Haha. I was told
to sleep more and relax. Maybe I needed more sleep recently. Dada did influece me a bit. But I need to get some naps on weekends.
