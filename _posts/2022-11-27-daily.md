**Protests** against lockdown are happening in many places, including top 2 universities. The stock market should be going down tmr, or even in the 
week period. However, the government may issue more dramatic policies which may lead to rebound. It's hard to keep any eye on markets when working.

Watched **Decision to Leave** today, it's supposed to win in the plots. But I think it's just ok. Not so into this art movies, rather prefer **Wires**.
Realistic.
