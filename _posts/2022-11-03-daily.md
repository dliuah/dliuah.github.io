I thought **Neural Network** can easily find the non-linear relationship between the variables and perform best. But in fact it's not, maybe the 
data is mostly linear, at least feature-wise. However, there should be some few features which are non-linearly relation, so maybe tree is better. 
Bagging and boosting, let's see how much can be improved.

I had a fever today, a little sleepy. The new canteen has a lot of food with my familar taste, however too expensive, although it's a buffet. I'd
rather it's a canteen style.

Yeah, I should get more sleep.
