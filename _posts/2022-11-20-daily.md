Today I have some symptoms, sneezing, feels a little fever, stomach not comfortable as past few days. I did a quick test and still negative. I guess
this is all the stomach secondary problem. I do need to keep it warm not less occupied recently.

Mush reopened **Trump**'s twitter. Today is the debut of **World Cup**. This is another 4 years. When is that time I watched World Cup with my grandpa?
12 or 16 years ago. I guess it's when I am 17? He really liked sports, I don't know why I didn't inherited much of it. He grew old so fast. 

I changed to a new **Union**. I guess I will retire here. Feels cozy.
