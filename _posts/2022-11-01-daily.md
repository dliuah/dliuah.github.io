Nalgae Typhoon will come tonight. Maybe signal 8 will be on tomorror. I though in winter the typhoon should be warm, instead it's dry and cold.

Today the stock market bounce back, but I am not optimistic about it. Even though the lockdown maybe lifted, the pursuit of equality over anything will 
reduce the chance for ludicarative return.
