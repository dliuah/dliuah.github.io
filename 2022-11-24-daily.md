The crypto is coming back a little. 

We got up early as Elaine needed to attend the CFA exam. The exam started at 8am but still able to go in after 7:30.

The game today is fun. Our team got the first place, I guess mainly because we have the most people. The opponents usually had 60%.

My **stomach** ached a little today. Not sure if the fever was because of this. Not sure what other symptoms will appear.

I really shouldn't play on my phone anymore. It's so hard to find some good reading books though.
